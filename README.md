# Kateto - Another Templating Tool for Kubernetes

Kateto is a tool for taming the Kubernetes beast by using Jsonnet while borrowing approaches and concepts from early contestants such as Tanka and Helm.

> [!NOTE]
> Despite our `0.x.y` releases being "production ready", don't expect API stability before a 1.0 release as [anything may change](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) due to experimentation and feedback.

## Documentation

If you would like more information about the tool's components and inner workings, please refer to the [documentation](./docs/index.md). There you'll find a description of the [package](./docs/kcp.md) structure and feature, along with the [commands](./docs/usage.md) with brief explanations about their tasks.

## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome, whether it is an issue or a PR. I'm very new to Golang, so anything in the code that seems wrong, feel free to point it out.
